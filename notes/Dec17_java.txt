Pattern of the assessment
1) Collections
	create an array list
	check if an item is found in the list or not
	add an element to the list

	map
		find models based on company name
		if found, remove
			remove is not possible using for-each loop
				you have to use iterator and remove method

			get the value based on key
				ex:	company name is key 			
					models arraylist is the value

		in map, if you use put method
			put(key, value)
				if key is already found, the value is updated in the existing entry
				if key is not found, then the new entry is added
		
		to find if key is already found or not,
			if(map.containsKey(company))
			{
				//key is already found
			}	



		ArrayList<String> models=map.get(company);	
		// if company is not found in the map, you will get null

		if(models==null)
		{
			//key not found
			//you are adding new entry to the map
			count=0;
		
		}
			count++;
			map.put(compay,count);




--------------------------------------------------
String
	split by @
	split by ,

Task:
--------
Get an input from the user and check if it is a valid ip address or not?
	split by . and convert every portion into int and then check the range is between 0-255 or not



TasK:
------
Accept a string input and display only the vowels

Hint:
	to convert a string into character array
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String input=sc.next();
		char []arr=input.toCharArray();

	for(char c : arr)
	{
		switch(c)
		{
			case 'a':
			case 'e':
			case 'i':
			case 'o':
			case 'u':
				System.out.println("Vowel");
				break;
			default:
				System.out.println("Not vowel");
				break;
		}
	}

----------------------------------
Anagram?

ex:
	tea
	eat
	ate

		these are anagrams

meat
team
	are anagrams

two words are anagrams if they are made of same characters

Task:

Write a java program to check if two strings are angrams



e.g: 
amit@doselect.com

, 

_ami@doselect.in

 are valid addresses, but 1ami@dos.com, amit@doselect are invalid addresses.



abcd

char + 3


a+3	=d
z+3	=c
y+3	=b

a=97
b=97+1
z=97+26

a=97
a=97+0
z=97+25

122

0 - 25

1) check if the character ascii is between 97 - 122
	//it is lower case alphabet

	acii+3 modulo 122

	a
		97 + 3 = 100%122	=	100 only	NO problems
	y	121+3=124%122	=	2	97+2-1	=99	c

	y becomes c		is it ok?

97, 98, 99, ....122

123 - 26	= 	97


expected 0.6	but it was 0





public String calcGST(Receipt r)
    {
      String productsQR=r.productsQR;
      //split the string by @ symbol
      String []arr=productsQR.split("@");
      Integer amount=0;
      for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
      {
        String []arr1=arr[i].split(",");
        int rate=Integer.parseInt(arr1[0]);
        int quantity=Integer.parseInt(arr1[1]);
        amount+=(rate*quantity);
      }
      amount=amount*12/100;
      return amount.toString();    
    }
}

------------------------------------------
Collections
	adding elements
	traversing or iterating or visiting the elements
	displaying all elements
	removing an element from the collection
	searching an element from the collection
	reversing
	sorting
	sorting  in desc order
	replacing elements in a collection
