overriding equals method
Collections
String
Exception



We discussed about 
	==
	equals()

What is the difference between the above two?
	== compares references (when the operands are ref types)
	equals method compares the values

a and b are objects	(ref types)
a==b	checks if their references are same
a.equals	checks if their values are same

Integer
Float
Double

Employee
	id
	name
	salary

Employee e1=new Employee(1,"Raja",123456); 
Employee e2=new Employee(1,"Raja",123456);

e1==e2	
	what will be result?
		false

e1.equals(e2)
	clarify whether Employee class has overridden the equals method or not?
