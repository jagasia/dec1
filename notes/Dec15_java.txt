overriding equals method
Collections
String
Exception



We discussed about 
	==
	equals()

What is the difference between the above two?
	== compares references (when the operands are ref types)
	equals method compares the values

a and b are objects	(ref types)
a==b	checks if their references are same
a.equals	checks if their values are same

Integer
Float
Double

Employee
	id
	name
	salary

Employee e1=new Employee(1,"Raja",123456); 
Employee e2=new Employee(1,"Raja",123456);

e1==e2	
	what will be result?
		false

e1.equals(e2)
	clarify whether Employee class has overridden the equals method or not?



Hint:
	you can check if 2 dates are equal or not using equals method
		dt1.equals(dt2)

TasK:
	Java Mock 11 Req 1
		point #6	override the equals method

	Override the equals method and paste the method code alone in chat



What is the difference between
	nextLine()	use only newline delimiter
	next()	use any delimiter		space / tab / newline


while user enters input


india is our country

	the entire line is captured as a String (when you use nextLine())
	india is captured by next() method



Whenever you use nextLine method after a
	next() or
	nextInt() or
	nextFloat() or
	any other methods, you will face a problem





IIT Madras,www.iitm.ac.in,7845612390,iit,16,Madras,15-12-1959
	we can split this String into multiple Strings 
		



Integer.parseInt("12");		returns an int
Integer.valueOf("12");		returns an Integer



equalsIgnoreCase()	checks if both are equal, ignoring the case
