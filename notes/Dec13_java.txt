Object Oriented programming
	inheritance
	polymorphism
	encapsulation
	abstraction
Platform independent		java language is same
portable
robust and secure
supports multithreading
compiler and interpreter

Compilation process of java program
	source code
	byte code

java program (source code) is not translated directly to machine language
	first it is translated into byte code	(compiler do this)

	1) javac		java compiler
	2) JIT		just in time compiler

in c or c++, the source code is translated (by the compiler) into machine language code.
	if compiler translates the code into a machine language code, then it works only in that kind of machine

OOPS

A java class name should follow these guidelines:

1) your class name is like 	firstprogram	NOT CORRECT. 	It cannot start with lower case
	correct way		PascalCase

	ex:
		FirstProgram
		Employee
		Product
		Order
	
2) class name must be a noun
	like an entity

3) should not start with a verb		a method name starts with a verb plus a noun	
	AcceptDetails		(wrong)
		method name:		acceptDetails()
	CalculateSimpleInterest	(wrong)


new
void
static
final
transient
volatile

instanceof

Method naming conventions:
	starts with a verb and ends with a noun


Variable naming conventions:

class JavaStudent

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

InputMismatchException

StringBuilder


class User

value types		all primitives are value types

int x=20;		what is x?		x is a variable of int type.	
		this variable name is a representation of a memory location

		if you go and see that location, what you see there?	is a value


Employee raja=new Employee();
		if you go and see "raja" variable, what you see there?	is not a value, but a reference to an object of employee


Memory

if you create a variable of primitive type, then
	it is a value type

Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

inputs can be separated by any delimiter
	space
	tab
	new line


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

Dice Game I

Each player will be allowed to throw  a dice 2 times. The points for each player will be calculated as follows :
If the values thrown are different, the points scored is equal to the sum of the 2 values.
If the values thrown are the same, the points scored is equal to double the sum of the 2 values.

Write a program to calculate the points scored by a player.

Input and Output Format:

Input consists of 2 integers. The valid range of inputs is from 0 to 6. [ Both 0 and 6 inclusive]
Output the points scored. In case of invalid inputs, print “Invalid Input”.

Refer sample input and output for formatting specificaions.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.]
Sample Input and Output 1:

Enter Value 1:
5
Enter Value 2:
6
The points scored is 11

Sample Input and Output 2:

Enter Value 1:

Dice Game II
Each player will be allowed to throw a dice 2 times. The points for each player will be calculated as follows :
The points scored is the absolute difference between 8 and the sum of the 2 values, provided the sum of the 2 values is less than 8.
In all other cases, the point  scored is double the absolute difference between 8 and the sum of the 2 values.

Write a program to calculate the points scored by a player.

Input consists of 2 integers. The valid range of inputs is from 0 to 6.
Output the points scored. In case of invalid inputs, print “Invalid Input”.

Lucky Prize IV
 	
In all the theatres in the Amphi Multiplex, prizes will be given to few lucky winners every day.
The lucky winners will be decided based on the ticket number and the criteria set for that day.
 
The criteria set for day 4 is that prizes will be given to all ticket holders whose ticket number satisy both the conditions given below :
1.	The ticket number is a palindrome
2.	The sum of the digits in the ticket number is even
 
Given a ticket number, write a program to determine whether that ticket holder will be a lucky prize winner or not.
 
Input and Output Format:
 
Input consists of an integer that corresponds to the ticket number.
Output consists of a string that is either “Winner” or “Not a winner”
 
Sample Input 1:
525
 
Sample Output 1:
Winner

Percentage of Runs
Sam is a cricket freak, who loves to collect statistics about the matches. Suppose, a batsman scored X runs which included Y fours and Z sixes, Sam wants to calculate the  percentage of the total score he made by running between the wickets.
Write a program to help Sam .
Input Format:
First input is an integer X that denotes the total runs scored.
Second input is an integer Y that denotes the  number of fours he has scored.
Third input is an integer Z that denotes the  number of sixes he has scored.
[Note: Assume all inputs are valid.] 
Output Format:
Output is a double value that denotes the percentage of runs he made by running between the wickets(rounded off to 2 decimal places).
Sample Input 1:
110
3
8
Sample Output 1:
45.45
Sample Input 2:
60
2
1
Sample Output 2:
76.66

Explanation for sample 1:
Total Runs = 110
No. of Fours = 3
No. of sixes = 8
Total runs scored by boundaries = 4*3 + 8*6 = 60
Therefore, runs scored by running between the wickets = 110 - 60 = 50
Percentage scored by running =(50/110)*100 =  45.45 
 
Maximum Product
Playing with arrays has become a hobby for Arun. This time Arun wants to find the greatest number in the array such that it is the product of any two numbers in the array.
Write a program to help Arun to the do the task. If no such number exists, then print -1.
[Note: The two number that are used to find the product can be the number itself.  For example, if the array elements are [1,2,3] , then 1*3 = 3 will be the solution for this array.]

Input Format :
First input is an integer value that denotes the size of the array.
Second input is a series of integers separated by space that denotes the array values.

Output Format :
Output is an  integer that denotes the maximum product.

Sample Input 1:
5
35 30 7 6 5
Sample Output 1:
35

Sample Input 2:
5
2 4 6 89 78
Sample Output 2:
-1
